# Identifying the Impact of Contextual and Personal Determinants of Online Social Conformity

This is the first user study related to my PhD thesis investigating online social conformity. <br/>
The main objective of this experiment was to investigate how popular face-to-face conformity determinants impact conformity in online settings. <br/>
We looked at how contextual determinants such as majority - minority group composition, and task objectivity, as well as subjective determinants like participant gender, self-confidence and personality traits influence conformity behaviour in an online quiz. <br/>

I created a simple web application to simulate an online quiz, where our participants answered a set of objective and subjective questions, followed by a big-five questionnaire (which captured their personality traits).<br/>
For more information on this experiment, please refer to our paper at https://www.senuriwijenayake.com/papers/2020/CHB20.pdf <br/>

## Setting up the web application and server

Step 1: Download the server code at https://github.com/SenuriWijenayake/Social-Conformity-S1-server.<br/>
Step 2: Run "npm install" using a Command Line Interface (CLI) to install all packages required for the server to run.<br/>
Step 3: Run "node app.js" on a CLI to start the server.<br/>
Step 4: Download this repository which includes the web application code.<br/>
Step 5: Open the "index.html" page of the web application to start the quiz.
